Users inputs integer numbers, one by one, until he/she inputs 0 to stop (0 is not mention in inputted list). You are asked to implement a program to print out the sum of all number in the longest ascending or descending sub-sequence from the inputted list. 
If there are 2 or more subsequences of the same size, print out the bigger sum. 
Ex: 
INPUT: 1 2 4 2 3 0 
OUTPUT: 7 
Explain: 1 2 4 is the longest ascending sub-sequence with length 3.
